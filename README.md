Stream Labs Application

#Description
Right now, I have an idea to allow a Twitch user to pick an avatar once they join a stream. Once they have chosen their avatar, an alert will pop up displaying the user's username and the avatar they have chosen. Also, would like the user to have an option to enter an optional message for the Twitch streamer to see.

//ReadMe file will be updated as the app is developed.
